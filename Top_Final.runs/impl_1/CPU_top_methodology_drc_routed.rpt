2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock U9/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT CLK_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin U6/Val_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin U6/Val_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock U9/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin U9/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net CLK100MHZ_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): U6/CLK100MHZ, CLK100MHZ_IBUF_inst/O, U9/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U2/Reset_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U2/ALUControl_reg[0]/CLR, U2/ALUControl_reg[1]/CLR, U2/ALUControl_reg[2]/CLR, U2/ALUSrc_reg/CLR, U2/Branch_reg/CLR, U2/JMP_reg/CLR, U2/MemWrite_reg/CLR, U2/MemtoReg_reg/CLR, U2/RegDst_reg/CLR, U2/RegWrite_reg/CLR, U2/Reset_reg/PRE.
